Created a project where we can pass location in url. server will create a uri to implement Visual Crossing Weather api. Used Http Client, Response , Request to send request and recieve response in
String Format. Converted the response to a custom class Weather DTO. Implemented a ratelimiting logic and redis caching logic, to cache custom return class.

Mainly Redis Caching cached the return object.
